# Scripts
> Scripts is a collection of scripts and small software I have created to help me
> in diverse tasks. They are not big enough to have their own repo but might be
> useful for someone else.

## Usage
Each folder contains a different script. The instructions to use each one of them
is contained in the folder. So far, the following scripts are available.

- [Maze](https://github.com/threkk/scripts/tree/master/maze): Generates a random
  maze in the terminal screen.
- [O'Reilly downloader](https://github.com/threkk/scripts/tree/master/oreilly_downloader):
Downloads the free ebooks offered by O'Reilly. They can
be downloaded by categories in different formats.
- [Shrug](https://github.com/threkk/scripts/tree/master/shrug): ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

## Why not `gists`?
[Gists](http://gist.github.com/) are repositories *on discount*. The purpose of
them is sharing small snippets of code. A full repository is more useful in
terms of reusing and editing the code.
